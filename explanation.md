# Explanation of the Project

## Overview
This project involves data processing, model training, and evaluation.

### Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Initial cleaning and transformation of raw data.
2. **Modeling**: Training several machine learning models and selecting the best one.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the selected model and saving it as a `.pkl` file.

## Notebooks
The following Jupyter notebooks contain the step-by-step process:
- `01_data_cleaning.ipynb`: Data preparation and cleaning.
- `02_modeling.ipynb`: Model training and comparison.
- `03_evaluation.ipynb`: Model evaluation and performance metrics.
