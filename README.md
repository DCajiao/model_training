## Exercise description
--------------------

In the context of a Marketplace an algorithm is needed to
predict if an item listed in the markeplace is new or used.

Your task to design a machine learning model to predict if an item is new or
used and then evaluate the model over held-out test data.

To assist in that task a dataset is provided in MLA_100k.jsonlines. Fin the dataset @ https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mzk9g5StOsIvi8TBIVX5CObAsrAOWhcL/view?usp=drive_link

For the evaluation you will have to choose an appropiate metric.

The deliverables are:
    - Notebook(s) with all the process.
    - A markdown file "explanation.md" with a short explanation on the criteria applied to train the model and the performance achieved on that metric.
    - create a pull request with the solution to this repository
